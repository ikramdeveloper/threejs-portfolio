        I've embarked on numerous projects throughout the years, but these are
        the ones I hold closest to my heart. Many of them are open-source, so if
        you come across something that piques your interest, feel free to
        explore the codebase and contribute your ideas for further enhancements.
        Your collaboration is highly valued!
